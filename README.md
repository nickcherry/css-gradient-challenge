# CSS Gradient Challenge

Build a simple CSS Gradient Generator in ~45 minutes.

> The half-baked mission, should you choose to accept it, is as follows:
>
> Implement a CSS gradient generator, in the vein of https://www.css-gradient.com/, which allows users to specify (at a minimum) a gradient style, direction, and a starting/ending color. In addition to rendering the configured CSS gradient, the application should also display the gradients being configured by other users of the site, preferably in real-time. Feel free to use whatever front-end frameworks you like. Ruby is preferred for the back-end. No authentication is required.

> Bonus points for:
> - use of websockets
> - well-designed front-end
> - more fully-featured gradient configurator (e.g. http://www.css3factory.com/linear-gradients)
